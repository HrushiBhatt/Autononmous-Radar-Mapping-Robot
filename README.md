# Jungle Path Finder
A jungle exploration robot programmed with embedded C, designed to help users navigate through obstacle-filled terrain, identify and map objects using infrared, PING, cliff, and bump sensors, and locate a hidden figure within a dense forest. Real-time data was visualized through a custom Python GUI for better situational awareness and control.

Built as part of an Embedded Systems course in a team of 5 engineers, focusing on hardware-software integration, autonomous navigation, and real-time sensor data processing.

# Autonomous Radar-Mapping Robot
A jungle exploration themed robot programmed with embedded C, designed to help users navigate through obstacle-filled terrain, identify and map objects using infrared, PING, cliff, and bump sensors, and locate a hidden figure within a dense forest. Real-time data was visualized through a custom Python GUI for better situational awareness and control.

Built as part of an Embedded Systems course on a team of 5 engineers, focusing on hardware-software integration, semi-autonomous navigation, and real-time sensor data processing. (CPRE 2880)

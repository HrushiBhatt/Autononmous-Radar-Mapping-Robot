## ‚ú® What it does
- **Real-time scanning:** 180¬∞ sweep with angle + distance sampling  
- **Object detection:** width/size estimation and target highlighting  
- **Live visualization:** interactive radar plot on your laptop  
- **Autonomy hooks:** data pipeline ready for navigation/avoidance logic

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Overview (how it‚Äôs built)
- **Firmware (C):** CyBot/Tiva MCU reads IR & PING sensors, filters data, computes object width, and packets readings as `!theta!r!size`.  
- **Comms (TCP):** Microcontroller opens a socket and streams packets to the PC.  
- **GUI (Python):** Tkinter + Matplotlib (polar) plots objects at true angles/distances and refreshes in real time.
